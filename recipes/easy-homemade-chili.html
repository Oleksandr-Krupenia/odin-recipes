    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Homemade chili is delicious and goes great with cornbread or over corn
      chips for a chili pie! I like to use spicy pinto beans.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Beef: The recipe starts with a pound of ground beef. You can use ground
        turkey if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion: Cooking a chopped onion with the ground meat adds tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Canned goods: You'll need a can of tomato sauce, a can of stewed
        tomatoes, and a can of kidney beans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices: This homemade chili is spiced with chili powder, garlic powder,
        salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place ground beef and onion in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook
        and stir until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 5 to 7
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato sauce, kidney beans, stewed tomatoes with juice, and
        water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.
        Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 15
        minutes.

    </ol>
